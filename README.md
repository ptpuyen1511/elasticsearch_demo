# elasticsearch_demo
This is my demo of learning Elasticsearch client in Python based on the tutorial [Getting started with Elasticsearch in Python](http://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/getting-started-with-elasticsearch-in-python/) 

My notebook includes three steps:

* Step 1: Collect data related to tax codes from the web: https://hosocongty.vn/

* Step 2: Store data using Elasticsearch

* Step 3: Query information on Elasticsearch
